# BlockBreaker
This chapter explores the rather mysterious subject of arrays and the related subject of tuples that goes along with it. The two are essentially the same thing: an array when used simply like an array, and a tuple when treated like a container object with properties and methods. A list is a Python class that we will also learn to use. We will use this new knowledge to create a game with pre-defined levels.<br />

In this chapter, you will learn to:<br />
• Define and use arrays and lists<br />
• Use a tuple as a constant array of data<br /> 
• Create a data-driven game
